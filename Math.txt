This directry introduces softwares written by MATLAB used in the above paper. 

1. Generalization loss of matrix factorization and its estimators. Cross Validation, WAIC, 
adjusted cross validation, hold-out cross validation, AIC, and DIC.

2. Free energy of matrix factorization and its approximations. Asymptotics, BIC, and WBIC.
