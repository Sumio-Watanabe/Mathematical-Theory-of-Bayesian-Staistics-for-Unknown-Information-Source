This directry introduces softwares written by MATLAB used in the above paper. 

1. Generalization loss of matrix factorization and its estimators. Cross Validation, WAIC, 
adjusted cross validation, hold-out cross validation, AIC, and DIC are compared. 

2. Free energy of matrix factorization and its approximations are studied, asymptotics, BIC, and WBIC.

3. Prior optimization in a polynomial regression. Cross validation, WAIC, adjusted cross validation,
and the free energy are compared.
